# Madoc

**Madoc** is a **MA**rkdown **DOC**umentation Framework.

It will help your generate a static documentation website.

How to get started easily:

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --save-dev @madoc/core svelte
# Initialize a project
madoc init
# Start the project in development
madoc dev
# Build the final website
madoc build
```

> You can see **svelte** is also needed, as Madoc is built with [Svelte].
